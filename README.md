# Amusement-Park-Database-Management-System
This is a database that will be used by the management of the amusement park to keep
records and retrieve relevant information which will assist them in their decision-making
process. This Database also caters to the needs of an online web application through
which users can book entry tickets or ride tickets. Computer systems have also been
installed at the local ticket window for that same purpose. The machines will also be
connected to this database. Using this database the management can figure out what rides
are popular among a particular demographic group. The Database also caters to the
management needs of the various food shops on the premises of the park-like keeping
track of items that are available and their sales. This will not only make selling food
seamless with online transactions but also help them analyze their sales data to make
business decisions. Maintenance of the premises and managing the visitors' experience
requires human resources. This database keeps the records of all employees as well as the
contractual appointments. Contractual appointments usually include maintenance
workers, medical staff, and performance artists invited for various events at the park.
Employees can order supplies for the amusement park. This Database also assists in
keeping purchase and stock records for the same. Regular inspections are conducted for
ensuring the safety and proper functioning of all the rides. The Database helps to keep
track of each such inspection. There is also a Lost Found service provided at various
points inside the park, for all complaints an entry is made into this database. The database
also keeps records of all valuable feedback provided by the visitors.
